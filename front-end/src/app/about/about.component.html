        My name is Josh and I'm the founder of MTN Pine. Mountains to me breathe a sense of beauty, danger, excitement and adventure
        into my soul. It's something I truly long for. They are where I'm reminded of purpose and where I take inspiration to create.<br><br>

        I’m also a sucker for the sentimental. A souvenir from a foreign travel, my grandfather’s old army chest, or a pair of shoes
        I held onto far too long; all items that hold a unique story. Other than the shoes, I want to pass those items and meaningful
        stories along.<br><br>

        This is why I create. When I craft a leather piece I do so hoping that it will be a means of inspiration for
        adventure and a vessel for a story; something meaningful that can be passed on.</p>
