### Getting Started

## User Research

Question 1: 
What do you look for in an online store?

 - User 1: "Easy to find products, easy navigation, simplicity"
 - User 2: "Well written descriptions on items, as much info as I can get since I am not purchasing it in person.  Plenty of pictures"

What are things that would turn you away from buying from an online store? 

- User 1: "Sketchy set up/old design"
- User 2: "When a store is too confusing and hard to navigate to find what I want"

What are some of your favorite online stores? 

 - User 1: https://arcteryx.com/, https://topodesigns.com/
